## üìå Project Overview

- Analysis of all IPL seasons to uncover patterns in team performance, player contributions, scoring dynamics, venue impacts, and evolving strategies.  
- Designed to help cricket analysts, fans, team strategists, and data enthusiasts understand what drives success in IPL.

---

## üìÇ Data Sources

- Match outcomes, scorecards, venues, toss decisions, player stats across all seasons.  
- Publicly available datasets (e.g. Kaggle, IPL official records, etc.).  
- Data cleaning handled missing values, inconsistent categories, duplicates.

---

## ‚ùì Key Questions Explored

- Which teams and players consistently perform across seasons?  
- How does the toss decision affect match result probability?  
- Impact of venue/home ground on team success.  
- Trends in average scoring (over seasons, by venues, by innings).  
- What factors most influence match outcome?  
- Can we predict winners, total runs, or toss winner using past data?

## üõ† Methodology & Tools

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Data Cleaning & EDA | Handling missing values, feature engineering, summarizing distributions and correlations. |
| Visualization | Use of plots (histograms, box plots, heatmaps, scatter plots), geographical visualizations, time series trends. |
| Statistical Tests | Hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square), ANOVA to compare means across groups. |
| Feature Engineering | Creating new variables like `first_innings_score`, `batting_or_bowling_first_effect`, venue-specific factors. |
| Predictive Modeling | Classification models (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for win prediction; regression models for score predictions. |
| Evaluation | Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC for classification; RMSE, MAE for regression. Cross-validation used to avoid overfitting. |

Tools / Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks.

## üìä Major Findings

- Toss decision has [impact details] (e.g. teams winning the toss and choosing to bat first have a higher win rate in certain venues).  
- Certain venues have shown consistently higher scoring.  
- Players with particular batting or bowling profiles show durable performance across years.  
- Trends in average game scores have increased over seasons.  
- Major factors influencing match outcomes include: **team strength**, **venue**, **toss decision**, **first-innings total**.

---

## ü§ñ Predictive Modeling

- Built classification models to predict match outcome with **X% accuracy** (e.g. Random Forest / XGBoost was best).  
- Regression model to estimate total match runs with mean error of **Y** runs.  
- Feature importance ranking highlights which variables are most predictive.

üîÆ Future Improvements
Incorporate ball-by-ball data for more granular insights.

Use advanced models (ensemble, neural networks) to improve predictions.

Build interactive dashboards for non-technical users.

Add scraping pipeline to keep data up to date each season.

Expand to include external factors (weather, player injuries, etc.).
